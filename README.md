#  Tyumen News Portal — UI/UX & Frontend Case Study

A comprehensive multi-page news portal concept. This project demonstrates the transition from a custom-designed Figma layout to a functional, responsive frontend implementation using Vanilla JavaScript.

##  Design-to-Code Workflow
This project was developed following a professional lifecycle:
1. **Visual Design:** Created a full-scale multi-page UI in Figma with a focus on typography and content hierarchy.
2. **Prototyping:** Structured the user journey across 6+ unique categories (Politics, Sport, Culture, etc.).
3. **Frontend Implementation:** High-fidelity conversion to HTML5 and CSS3 with a focus on "Pixel Perfect" accuracy.
